# Organs, Please

In Organs, Please you play as a doctor deciding who gets donor organs, and who gets left on the waiting list. Learn more about organ transplants and procedures, and gain insight into your own morals. 

Organs, Please is currently being developed for Macalester College's class COMP 225 - Software Design and Development. This github contains files for Unity.
